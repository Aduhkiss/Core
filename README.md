# Core Plugin

This is a spigot plugin that will act as the core plugin for any new servers I develop for. It's really 
easy to use. It uses a MySQL database to store account, and server information so you can use it
across many servers, or for a bungeecord network.

I will soon provide copies of the .sql files for easy database setup, but for now I want to focus dev time
to making the plugin better.

We use a ton of custom elements, such as the command system, permission system, and chat system, and this plugin
is designed to handle all components of a Minecraft Server.

Please contact me for any questions or concerns.
